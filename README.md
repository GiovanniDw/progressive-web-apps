> GitHub - cmda-minor-web/progressive-web-apps-2223: The course Progressive Web Apps is about learning to build server side rendered applications. Progressive Web Apps is part of the half year minor programme about Web Design and Development in Amsterdam. Bachelor Communication and Multimedia Design, Amsterdam University of Applied Science.

### Goals

After finishing this program you can:

- *deal with server side rendering;*
- *implement a Service Worker;*
- *enhance the critical render path for a better runtime or percieved performance.*

| *Project*              | Your app is published and can be accessed using the browser. Your project is thoroughly documented in the R`EADME.mdf`ile in your repository. Included are an explanation of client- server rendering, an activity diagram including the Service Worker and a list of enhancements to optimize the critical render path implemented your app. |
| *Serverside rendering* | Youâ€™ve implemented serverside rendering and have articulated how it works and why you should want it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| *Service Worker*       | Youâ€™ve implemented a usefull Service Worker and show itâ€™s working in an activity diagram.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| *Critical render path* | Youâ€™ve enhanced the critical render path for a better runtime or percieved performance in multiple ways and have described how you managed to do this.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
